1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices
2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses
{% endhint %}

* Let's look at the requests in the `Proxy > HTTP history` tab in Burpsuite.

* We can see that the request sent on clicking the `Red` button is a GET request while the one sent on clicking the `Blue` button is a POST request.
* We can now send either one of these requests to the `Repeater` and modify the request.

* We changed the request method to HEAD which asks for a response identical to that of a GET request, but without the response body.
* Let's send this request.
