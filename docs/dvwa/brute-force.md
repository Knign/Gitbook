## Security Level: Low

* The application provides us with two input fields in order to enter the username and the password.
* Let's enter `admin` as both.

* Let's intercept the request in Burpsuite.

* We can now forward this request to the `Intruder` to automate the attack.

* After adding a field to the password, we can move on to setting up the substitution payload.&#x20;

* For the payload type we want a simple list, more specifically the `darkweb2017-top100.txt` passwords lists from the `seclists` collection.
* Before we start the attack there is something important that we have to do.
* In the `Options` tab, we can set the string to grep for. We can set it to the following:

```
Username and/or password incorrect.
```

* Let's start the attack.

* We can immediately see that the response for `password` did not include the string.
* Let's take a closer look at the response.

* We can see that it greets us with a welcome message. This means that the password is `password`.
