##

> Q1. What is the FTP password?

* We can set the filter such that it filters out FTP packets.

```
ftp
```

* Following the TCP stream via `Follow > TCP Stream`, we can see the password.

##

> Q2. What is the IPv6 address of the DNS server used by 192.168.1.26? (####::####:####:####:####)

* We can filter the DNS packets using the following filter:

```
dns
```

* On analyzing the packet, we can see the source MAC address.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* We can create a second filter as follows:

```
eth.src == c8:09:a8:57:47:93 && ipv6 && dns
```

* Let's look at the first packet.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 2.2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* We can see the IPv6 address of the DNS server in the `Destination Address` field.

##

> Q3. What domain is the user looking up in packet 15174?

* Let's filter out the relevant packet.

```
frame.number == 15174
```

* The domain is specified in the `Queries` filed of the DNS message.

##

> Q4. How many UDP packets were sent from 192.168.1.26 to 24.39.217.246?

* We can filter the relevant packets using the following filter:

```
ip.src == 192.168.1.26 && ip.dst == 24.39.217.246 && udp
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 4.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* We can see that there are 10 packets that fit the description.

##

> Q5. What is the MAC address of the system being investigated in the PCAP?‚Äù

* We already found the answer to this while researching for a previous question.

##

> Q6. What was the camera model name used to take picture 20210429\_152157.jpg ?

* Since the image is a file, we can filter out for FTP-Data.

```
ftp-data
```

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 6 (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* We can see the file being moved. On following the TCP stream we can see the contents of the file.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 6.2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* There's the camera model name. However there is a better way to do this.
* Let's save the image in `Raw` format.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 6.3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Using `exiftool` we can view the metadata of the image.

```
$ exiftool 20210429_152157.jpg 
--snip--;
Camera Model Name               : LM-Q725K
--snip--;
```

##

> Q7. What is the server certificate public key that was used in TLS session: da4a0000342e4b73459d7360b4bea971cc303ac18d29b99067e46d16cc07f4ff?

* We can filter the packet based on the session ID the we have been provided with.

```
tls.handshake.session_id == da:4a:00:00:34:2e:4b:73:45:9d:73:60:b4:be:a9:71:cc:30:3a:c1:8d:29:b9:90:67:e4:6d:16:cc:07:f4:ff
```

* In the `Server key Exchange` field we can find the `Pubkey`.

##

> Q8. What is the first TLS 1.3 client random that was used to establish a connection with protonmail.com?

* We have to first set a filter.

```
frame contains protonmail.com && tls
```

* Let's look at the first packet. In the `Random` field we can find the answer to our question.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 8.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

##

> Q9. What country is the MAC address of the FTP server registered in? (two words, one space in between)

* On filtering for `ftp` traffic, we can find the source MAC address.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 9.3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* We can then search this MAC address on DNSChecker.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 9.2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Alternatively, we can also use macaddress.io.&#x20;

##

> Q10. What time was a non-standard folder created on the FTP server on the 20th of April? (hh:mm)

* We need to first filter for FTP-Data.

```
ftp-data
```

* On following the TCP stream, we can see a list of folders.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 10.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Out of all the folders in the list the `ftp` folder is the non-standard one.

##

> Q11. What domain was the user connected to in packet 27300?

* We have to first set a filter.

```
frame.number == 27300
```

* We can see the destination address of the packet.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/packetmaze 11.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Now let's go to `Statistics > Resolved Addresses` in order to see if this IP address has been resolved or not.
