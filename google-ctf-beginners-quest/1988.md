# 1988

## CHALLENGE 0

* On clicking on the link, we are met with a PDF whose content is seemingly redacted.

* The flag has been hidden with a black highlight.
* The problem with this technique is that even though we cannot see the hidden text in the current document, we can simply copy and paste it some other document. On doing so, the highlight will not be copied and we will be able to read the redacted text.
